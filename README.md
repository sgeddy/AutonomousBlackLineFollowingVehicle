This is the code from my ECE 306 course, Introduction to Embedded Systems. All files are either headers files or written in C. The robot is controlled with an MSP-430 low-power, microcontroller and is built on a fiberglass chassis. Two 5v, DC motors are used to power the robot's wheels and steer. The microcontroller is equipped with an LED emmiter and two infrared sensors to distinguish the black electrical tape that makes the track and determine the appropraite correction. The microcontroller is also equipped with a GPS chip, which allows the robot to be controlled by coordinate-based logic.
